CLOUDSERVERPROTOCOL='https://'
CLOUDSERVERPORT=443
```
#### `cloudmanager.accounts`
Defines the usernames/passwords to be used  
*The first user is used as default*
```
---- Add accounts one per line, as in USERNAME:PASSWORD
---- You can use an "App Password" to access your account (instead of your regular password)
---- Settings > Personal > Security > Enter App Name > Create new app password
---- The first user is the default user, the rest can be used with -u <usernamme>
---- Lines starting with four dashes will be ignored
myUsername:myPassword
```
## Localization

You can also force a language with `-l <language_code>`.  
  
#### Currently supported languages

## Help
You can use the parameters `-h` or `--help` to get the help information.
